# Why I love ten percent time!
---


### Quick update 

You may or may not know that I recently changed jobs.  I'm now a Principal Software Engineer at [Ditto Music](https://www.dittomusic.com/).  

I was brought in, along with a couple of other friends (we've all worked together previously) to form a new team to build a completely new cloud infrastructure in AWS, and design and build all new systems/services to allow the company to grow and scale.

Whilst we've all been coding together for years and building and deploying apps across all of AWS product offerings using Terraform keeping all our infrastructure as code,  we are all new to the music industry so there is an awful lot to learn!  

As you can imagine, we've been extremely busy. Starting from absolutely nothing, we've now got a number of fully terraformed AWS environments.  We've not only built out the infrastructure though, we've also been working on a brand new product, featuring a slick React UI, many C# WebAPI micro services, ElasticSearch, GraphQL and utilising many of the different AWS products. Including but not limited to Lambda, ECS, SQS, S3, ElastiCache, EC2, ElasticSearch, CloudFront, Route53, CloudWatch. The list goes on and on! 

But even with all this going on, and the pressure to deliver and prove our worth to the business.  We are lucky to work in an environment, and for a great manager that not only values 10% time, but rather actively pushes us to ensure we take it, and this I absolutely love!

### Ten percent time - Say what? 

For those that don't know what I'm talking about, I think it was a Google initiative.  Where they said to their engineers that they could use 20% of their normal working hours to concentrate and work on their own ideas and side projects.  That's right Google got 20% time not 10% time, but that's Google and they hella rich.  

Some of Googles most famous and most successful products actually came from 20% time.  Gmail, Google Maps, Adsense and even Google Now. Which is now known as the Google Assistant.


### Benefits

When you realise products such as those listed above had humble beginnings as one devs little side project or idea, it's perhaps easy to see there is some value in this little initiative. Certainly for the business!

But it's the hidden benefits which I really think are worth a mention.

The first thing I believe is there is no better initiative, that provides such a great opportunity to developers. To be able to experiment and try out new things. New tools, languages, platforms etc.

Some of the things we try might come to nothing, or they may not have an immediate or obvious benefit to the business. But adding experience, and new tools to the arsenal will always reward somewhere down the line.

I've worked in companies before that have tried to make this process far too formal, and it's had the opposite effect. It's made trying new things seem more like a chore, and taken the enjoyment out of what we might normally even choose to do for fun in our spare time! 

The next benefit for me at least is overall happiness and feeling that the business I am working for really values me, and my continued progression.  When you're given such freedom to experiment, I think it shows a certain level of trust from the business that they know they've got good people, who want to find real value in that time.

Another benefit of 10% time it might not be a side project or new idea that gets done.  It could just be that nice to have feature you've been wanting to implement, or a little maintenance you've been putting off. 

Because we are free to do anything we choose, often times it might just be the little nice to haves like this that we focus on. So the business is getting little tweaks here and there, along side the normal day to day releases.

I actually did this for my last 10% time.  I just built a handy tool that the business would find useful, that wasn't important enough to prioritise over anything else. But just makes 1 thing a little easier to manage.


### My next 10% time idea - Vault

So the reason for this blog post is to introduce my latest idea.  The product I am going to build I intend to write a series of blog posts about here, where I will take you from start to finish. Explaining code samples, for the Terraform, and likely even the C# & React.

I identified a problem pretty quickly, because it's a problem we all have. Not just in businesses but in our personal lives as well.

Managing Passwords!

Not just passwords of course, as developers we have to store all kinds of details. Some of which will be passwords, but could just be computer names, addresses anything.

At home I use KeePass.  I keep a copy of the DB in my Google Drive, I keep the keys elsewhere and the password in my head.  But this is a chore, especially when trying to keep multiple machines in sync.

This problem is bad enough for me on my own, but imagine this in a business.  Nightmare.

So I decided I would build a solution.  I have the tech stack clear in my head. I've defined a card in our Trello board.  It's almost time to start.

I have a key principle for the system.  Simplicity.  Borrowing from Google I want to keep the application UI to be as simple as absoutely possible. 

If I get this right, I hope it will become an application that not only us devs use at Ditto, but everyone.  To securely store their work related stuff, even their personal stuff if they want to. 

I'm really hoping I can build an app that people love, and find real value in.

So stick around. I will be starting the application in the next few days, and blog posts will be coming at every step of the journey!  

Wish me luck!
