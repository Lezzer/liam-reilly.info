One of my most favourite personal moments these days is picking a new book to read from my ever-growing bookshelf.

Today is that day!

I've bought many books this year, far more than I will probably even have time to read this year. I've bought around
10-15 books this week covering a large variety of topics including psychology, branding, business strategy, computing
books and more.

I am addicted to reading now, and I have a thirst for knowledge to help me grow as a human being first and foremost, but
also to add some new skills to help me to make my business a success.

I have received a book delivery most days this week, and they will continue long into next week, today is one of those
days. I ordered two books by Dr Gad Saad. The Parasitic Mind is not yet with me but an earlier book of his arrived today
so I think I've got my next book picked out.

The Consuming Instinct - Dr Gad Saad
