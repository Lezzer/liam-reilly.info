I've been reading a lot this year. I like to start each day reading a chapter or two of a book
rather than doom scroll social media. I find myself to be much happier and productive when I do
this!

Because I'm reading so many books now I wanted a way to keep track, so I figured why not use this
website to keep track. So today I've added a new books page, with a simple timeline showing the
books I've read so far in 2021.

It's very simple for now, but I plan to expand it and make it a bit more useful in the future.

Please take a look and get in touch if you have any recommendations or want to talk about
something I've read.
