I don't often read two books in a row from the same author or even on the exact same subject, but
I find Gad Saad so interesting I've done just that again this month.

You might have noticed that in January I did read both Tyson Fury books back to back, and whilst
you can't tell from the website I did also read 2x MMA books to back last year. (Michael
Bisping: Quitters Never Win and Dan Hardy: Part Reptile). But this isn't my modus operandi.

**The Parasitic Mind: How Infectious Ideas Are Killing Common Sense** arrived a couple of days
before I finished reading **The Consuming Instinct** and I couldn't wait to jump into the new book
so that's what I did, the very next day!

If you're a bit fed up of woke nonsense seemingly destroying every facet of modern society and
wonder how/why things are the way they are right now I thoroughly recommend you check out the
book. It's brilliant!
