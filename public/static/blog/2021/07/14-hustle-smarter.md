Anybody that knows me knows that I've always been a huge fan of 50 Cent. I can still remember where I was sat that
Friday night back in 2003 whilst listening to Tim Westwood when he played practically every track off of his album **Get
Rich or Die Tryin**. A few months later I was watching him perform the album live on the tour of the same name, here in
England. I still listen to that album today and enjoy it just as much as I did all those years ago.

Since then 50 has continued to evolve and has seemed to print money with one successful business after another and there
is probably a generation of kids now that only know him for making hit TV shows.

So following on from reading the autobiographies of Phil Knight (NIKE) and Ray Kroc (McDonalds)
what better book could there be for me to read other than 'Hustle Harder, Hustle Smarter by Curtis (50 Cent) Jackson':

I've actually read 5 chapters already, and it's incredible, but I knew it would be because I'd already had a glimpse
into the way Curtis Jackson operates from reading **The 50th Law** earlier in the year. That book was written
collaboratively by the legendary Robert Greene (The 48 Laws of Power) and 50 Cent.

This latest book really does show you behind the curtain, breaks down previous business deals and shares many of his
secrets and explains the way his mind works and how yours should too, if you want to succeed in life.

I can't wait to read the 2nd half of the book!
