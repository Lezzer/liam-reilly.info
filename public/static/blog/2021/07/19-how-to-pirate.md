Back in April I read a great book called **Be More Pirate** by Sam Conniff.

I will be honest I bought the book largely based on the cover alone.

Isn't it great?

Thankfully the contents of the book are great too, and it really lived up to the awesome front cover. Dispelling the
myth that "you can't judge a book by its cover". I enjoyed this book so much I was telling everybody about it.

I've always been rebellious by nature. I don't do things just because that's the "done" thing, or the way it's always
been done.  I question everything and prefer to trust my own judgement and instincts rather than blindly accept what I'm being told
without doing my own research first. So I think I'd make a pretty good pirate and like Steve Jobs said "I'd rather be a
pirate than join the navy".

The book is full of surprising facts about the many things pirates did that helped shape a better and fairer society.
Not what you would expect based on the image pirates have in the world today, but honestly you owe more to pirates than
you might think!

I won't spoil the book but if you're starting a business, searching for a good cause or more meaning in your life or
simply want to learn more about pirates, I can't recommend this book highly enough.

So when I saw there was a new book out I had to buy it immediately.

I have high hopes for this book.  The cover is still really striking when you see it in person.  I just hope the content
is as exciting.  It's not written by Sam this time, but instead by Alex who was hired to help Sam manage the success 
that the first book brought.  This book is the story of how the book became a movement and shares the stories of 
individuals and businesses that embraced it.
