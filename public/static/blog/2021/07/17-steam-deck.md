# STEAM DECK... OR SWITCH PRO?

#### AM I RIGHT ðŸ¤£

Joke; I'm right. I mean look at it.

Jokes aside I want one of these. It looks amazing.  

I am fortunate enough to own a very nice gaming PC, as well as multiple consoles, but I have more gaming options than I 
have time.  With the way modern gaming has gone with the constant updates and operating system upgrades I find I really
have to commit to gaming these days if I'm going to be gaming on my PC or a console.

The one console I do find myself using alot though is my Nintendo Switch which I bought earlier in the year.  I love the
flexibility of that device.  I love that I can just pick it up jump into a quick game immediately and I love that I can 
do this anywhere.  In the office, in the kitchen and even in bed.

So when Valve shocked everyone and announced the Steam Deck I was very interested.  The idea that I will be able to 
play my PC games on my PC when I have more time, but I will also be able to quickly pick them up and take them with me 
sounds perfect. Especially for us older gamers that have more of life's responsibilities getting in the way!

Everything about this device sounds great. The flexibility expands far beyond being able to pick up and play.  It's a full
blown PC.  You can dock it to a screen, a keyboard/mouse, a fight stick, even your AirPods if you want.  You can use other
gaming stores such as Epic or you can wipe the device entirely and install another OS.  

It's a unique and refreshing change from the usual locked down default position of other vendors. Looking at you Apple.

The pricing and range of SKUs seems to have something for everyone too.  Not sure which one I'll go for yet, either the 
middle or the top end but even the cheapest option is only limited by storage space/speed, and the storage is exandable
with SD cards anyway. 

It's a very exciting device, and I am very excited if you can't tell :)
