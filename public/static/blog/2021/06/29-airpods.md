# My Apple AirPods Pro just went from hero to zero in no time...

Let me start by saying I've been a massive fan of my Apple AirPods for years now. I had a pair of
the originals which I used daily for a year or so and I upgraded to the AirPods Pro in September 2020.

I absolutely loved my original AirPods and recommended them to people all the time. I had mixed
feelings when I upgraded to the AirPods Pro, as I wasn't a huge fan of the Silicon tips. Seemed
like a step backwards to me, and I found the originals sat in my ear much more comfortably. But I
soon got used to them and appreciated the new noise cancellation features.

Recently however I noticed my ears were extremely sore. They were sore to the touch, I noticed
this when cleaning them. I also noticed that my ears seemed very waxy later on in the day which
is very unusual and something that isn't normally a problem. Finally, I noticed my ears started
to become flaky as well as sore.

I stopped using my AirPods Pro immediately at this point and went back to the wired headphones
that came with my iPhone. My ears quickly healed and returned to normal. So I tried the AirPods
Pro again. I listened to music for an hour or so and took a couple of phone calls. I then
removed them and waited to see if the ear problems would return over the next day or
so...**they did!**

I have now repeated this same test on three separate occasions, weeks apart. Each time my ears
were perfectly normal, and I'd only used wired earphones. Each time a day or two after using the
AirPods Pro my ears would develop sores, flakes and all that good stuff.

I've searched online and I've seen people reporting the same issue. Many are suggesting that the
problem is an allergic reaction to the Silicon tips, but I do not think this is the true cause. I
wore these for months without a problem. This is a problem that has developed very recently.

I have theories as to what is causing this, but I don't want to talk openly about these yet. I
will try some alternative tips and see if that helps.

I hope this isn't caused by what I think it is though as it's getting next to impossible to find
wired alternatives these days, and I expect pretty soon there will be no wired alternatives in
production at all.
