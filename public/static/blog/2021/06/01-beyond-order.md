Another new month, another book delivery. I swear I will not purchase any more books for the rest
of the year now!

I started the year with a handful of physical books scattered around my house but when I decided
to improve my home office, a bookshelf was top of the list of things I needed to buy. I grossly
overestimated the number of books I owned and built a bookshelf floor to ceiling which looked
embarrassingly bare when I put my handful of books on the shelves!

Fast forward a few months and it's now looking much healthier with 70+ books on the shelf
currently with a couple more books still due to arrive.

I finished reading my current book 'The Parasitic Mind: How infectious ideas are killing common
sense' by the wonderful Gad Saad this morning and I have to say I think this book should be
required reading in every high school and college/university. I cannot praise this book highly
enough and thoroughly recommend you grab a copy today. Society depends on it! It really is that
good.

A number of new books were delivered which I'm looking forward to reading but as I sat at my desk
looking over them all I found myself automatically reading the complete overture section of
'Beyond Order' by the equally fantastic Jordan B. Peterson and with that subconsciously I
decided my next read.

I'm quite happy that it worked out this way to be honest. My recent reading order has been as
follows:

- **Jordan B. Peterson** - 12 Rules for Life. An antidote to Chaos.
- **Dr Gad Saad** - The Consuming Instinct.
- **Dr Gad Saad** - The Parasitic Mind. How infectious ideas are killing common sense.
- **Jordan B. Peterson** - Beyond Order.

Quite a nice symmetry, a natural order from Chaos even :)
