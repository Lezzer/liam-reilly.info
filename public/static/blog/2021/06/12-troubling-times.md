> Dare to think for yourself - Voltaire

We are truly living through troubling times right now. Life has been pretty good in my lifetime.
No world wars or even civil wars in England at least. It's my belief that this changed in 2019.

When you think of wars you probably think of tanks, bombs and fighting. This is how wars are
fought right? This is how traditional wars **were** fought!

It's my honest belief we are currently living through World War 3 but because the style has
changed most people just don't realise it's begun.

Wars are waged in secret. Corruption, propaganda and never ending marketing of fear are all
that's required to defeat the enemy. That enemy is you and me!

Over the last year I've spent far too much time closely observing the never ending propaganda in
this country (England) and abroad including the US, Canada, France and more. I've seen world
leaders tell lie after lie, move goal post after goal post whilst peoples lives have been
becoming increasingly worse.

At first glance it may appear like every country is acting independently and making its own rules
but this simply isn't true at all. It's the same playbook everywhere with only minor
differences.

It's quite overwhelming trying to work out what's happening and where we are heading next with
big tech routinely censoring information but finally I've found a good book that helps us
understand what's going on, certainly in England.

# A State Of Fear - Laura Dodsworth

As soon as I saw this book I knew I had to read it! Today I've read the first four chapters and
right from the introduction Laura provides data and facts which have been completely and
deliberately missing from the media and Government updates.

I will be flying through this book over the next few days, and then I will be sending copies out
to friends/family. It's truly a book I think everybody **needs** to read!

Whether you want to admit it or not, things are far from normal right now and if you ever want
your old normal to return you need to learn how you're being manipulated and learn how to fight
back! You need to learn to think for yourself!

I urge you to pick up a copy and give it a read!
