I recently watched a movie that I randomly found on Amazon Prime called 'The Founder'. I knew
nothing about it going in and ended up enjoying it immensely. The movie tells the true story of
the earliest days of Mcdonald's and how it came to be the multinational juggernaut that it is
today. If you've not seen it I definitely recommend it, and I will try to avoid spoilers in this
post.

As an ambitious business owner myself I was particularly intrigued by a character in the movie
called Ray Kroc who was played brilliantly by Michael Keaton.

A few weeks after watching the movie I was searching online for various entrepreneurial books,
particularly autobiographies when I came across **Grinding It Out** by the man
himself Ray Kroc.

So this is my current read. I'm very excited to read the story in more detail and to pick up some
hints/tips and motivation to keep me focussed on my goals.
