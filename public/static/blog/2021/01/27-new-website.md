After years of neglect I decided to completely rebuild and slightly re-design this website.

The website has now been re-built using the very latest versions of NextJS & React.

I intend to use this website a lot more going forward as I reduce my big tech/social media and
bring more content to the web on a platform I build myself.

Microblogging and images will be amongst the first of the new features to arrive sometime this
year (hopefully).

But this is depending on largely how much free time I can find when I'm not building
products/websites for my business Alchemist Labs.

Stay tuned!
